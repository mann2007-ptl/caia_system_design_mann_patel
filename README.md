## 📌 Project Overview

**CAIA System Design Knowledge Base** is a full-stack application designed to provide a centralized platform for learning, exploring, and analyzing system design concepts.

The system is built using a **real-world dataset of system design prompts and detailed responses**, enabling users to search, filter, and interact with high-quality architecture knowledge in a structured way.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a **scalable RESTful API system**
* Design schema based on **real dataset structure**
* Implement **advanced search & filtering**
* Provide **analytics & trending insights**
* Enable **user personalization (bookmarks, notes)**
* Follow **clean architecture & PR practices**

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

System design preparation is often scattered across multiple platforms with:

* ❌ No centralized knowledge base
* ❌ Poor search and filtering
* ❌ No structured categorization
* ❌ No tracking of important concepts

---

## 💡 Solution

This project solves the problem by creating a **structured knowledge base system** where users can:

* Browse system design prompts
* Read detailed explanations
* Filter by category, concept, and type
* Search across prompts and responses
* Track trending and popular topics
* Bookmark and save important content

---

## 🧠 Dataset Structure

The application is built on a structured JSON dataset:

```json id="dataset-structure"
{
  "prompt": "System design question",
  "response": "Detailed explanation",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "Foundations",
    "subcategory": "Scalability",
    "concept": "Horizontal vs vertical scaling",
    "question_type": "design",
    "generated_at": "2025-08-20T17:49:57.932316"
  }
}
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

The schema is designed **directly based on dataset analysis**:

```js id="schema-final"
{
  prompt: String,
  response: String,
  metadata: {
    category: String,
    subcategory: String,
    concept: String,
    question_type: String,
    generated_at: Date
  },
  views: Number,
  bookmarks: Number,
  isArchived: Boolean
}
```

### ✅ Key Design Decisions

* Used `prompt` instead of `title`
* Stored full explanation in `response`
* Nested `metadata` for structured filtering
* Added `views`, `bookmarks` for analytics
* Used indexing for fast search

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a **modular layered architecture**:

* **Frontend (React)** → UI & user interaction
* **Backend (Express)** → API handling
* **Database (MongoDB)** → Data storage
* **Middleware Layer** → Auth, logging, validation

## 📥 Data Import Strategy

The dataset is imported using:

* `insertMany()` for bulk insertion
* JSON parsing and transformation
* Metadata mapping to schema

---

## 🧪 Testing

* API testing using Postman
* CRUD validation
* Search & filter testing
* Error handling verification

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations
